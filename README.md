# nand2tetris
## What is nand2tetris?
It's a full guide to building a computer from scratch!<br>
You start from just a NAND gate and in the create a fully functional (if limited) computer.

## Why go through all that effort
It's fun, interesting, and helps you understand what makes a computer tick.<br>
Also, the sense of accomplishment<sup>TM</sup> you get when your DIY computer finally runs something does a lot to motivate you.


## TO DO
Although the project has been inactive for some time I still intend to work on it.
- [ ] Reimplement all the circuits that can be simplified (Thank you Computational Logic)
- [ ] Clean up the implementation of the assembler
- [ ] Implement the compiler
- [ ] Actually finish the project

## Contributions 
I do not receive direct contributions for this project - as it's a learning project for myself<br>
But if you see a mistake feel free to open an issue.<br>
Of course, you are free to use this as help for your own nand2tetris project. Or as a guide for what not to do :D
